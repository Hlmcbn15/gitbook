## **Q,What can I do with UnUniFi Protocol?**

The UnUniFi Protocol has four primary use-cases: \
・As long as users pledge NFTs to UnUniFi, the rewards will come in on their own through the automatic operation of the issued stable coins. And it is also possible to issue synthetic assets using cryptocurrencies as collateral. \
・Users can generate Synthetic assets, by locking collateral(including JPU, EUU, USU) in a smart contract. \
・Users may stake JPU, EUU or USU for a yield. When earning interest income, there is a huge demand for using coins with low price volatility as collateral. \

## **Q,How is GUU different from JPU?**

GUU ($GUU) is a utility token for governance or commission used in the UnUniFi Protocol

## **Q,Why Does GUU Have Value?**

The GUU cryptocurrency is used to reward users who mint JPU, and it plays a key role in the governance of the UnUniFi Protocol.

More specifically, GUU distributes the management of operations on the network, enabling anyone who holds and stakes the cryptocurrency to vote on its software policies and rules.

This means that by owning and staking GUU, users can vote to change certain parameters of the software. These include, but are not limited to, the assets the protocol accepts as collateral, the collateralization ratio required and the fees paid by borrowers.

Users can also delegate GUU to the validators who manage its blockchain and compete for newly minted GUU, allocating votes to them to earn a portion of the stability fees paid by users closing their CDPs.

## **Q,Why Use GUU?**

UnUniFi Protocol may be appealing based on its ability to provide cryptocurrency owners with access to decentralized lending services.

Borrowing against one’s cryptocurrency allows users to retain ownership of these assets while receiving other collateral that can be used to purchase goods and services.

Investors may also seek to buy GUU should they believe in the promise of DeFi and the ability of these protocols to disrupt traditional financial services.

## **Q,What are the rules for borrowing JPU?**

On UnUniFi Protocol, JPU is often over-collateralized, meaning that borrowers must deposit an amount that is typically higher than the value of JPU minted by the protocol.

The ratio of debt-to-collateral is then used to calculate the liquidation price.

For example, a collateralization ratio of 150% would mean that a user will get liquidated if the value of the cryptocurrency locked in the protocol falls below 1.5x the JPU they have borrowed.

## **Q,What happens if the collateral assets fall in value and the required collateral is not enough?**

If the debt-to-collateral value drops below a specified threshold, the collateral held in smart contracts will automatically be liquidated and burned.

## **Q,What are the rules for repayment?**

There is no repayment deadline. The borrowed JPU can be used indefinitely.\
&#x20;You can withdraw your collateral at any time by returning the JPU.\
&#x20;You can also withdraw excess collateral at any time as long as you maintain a minimum collateral ratio.

## **Q,Who’s running it?**

It is operated by Botany LLP(Yu Kimura, Takeru Shimojima, Kenji Yanagisawa). It is mainly developed by the members of [CauchyE, Inc](https://cauchye.com).
