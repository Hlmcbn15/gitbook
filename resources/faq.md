## **Q,What can I do with UnUniFi Protocol?**

The UnUniFi Protocol has four primary use-cases: \
・Users can generate Synthetic assets, by locking collateral(including JPU, EUU, USU) in a smart contract. \
・Users can trade any Synthetic assets on blockchain. \
・Users may stake JPU, EUU or USU for a yield. When earning interest income, there is a huge demand for using coins with low price volatility as collateral. \
・Users may take out a series of collateralized loans to create synthetic leverage for any supported crypto asset. For instance, it is possible to lock BTC and mint JPU, EUU or USU to buy BTC, hence creating a leveraged long position on BTC. There will be more use cases in the future.\


## **Q,Which crypto assets can be used as collateral?**

On UnUniFi Protocol is bringing collateralized debt positions (CDPs) to the Cosmos interchain ecosystem. With the UnUniFi Protocol users are able to borrow a JPY-pegged stablecoin (JPU) against their crypto collateral. Initially, BTC can be used as collateral, and there are plans to deal with other major crypto assets.

The value proposition of the stablecoins proposed in this protocol is that they are crypto-backed stablecoins, decentralized, multi-collateralized, and scalable. In addition to issuing stablecoins, this protocol will issue synthetic assets pegged to the index of tokens on GameFi, Metaverse and NFT, which have been heating up recently. The UnUniFi Protocol aims to expand the size of the market by introducing a new investment approach to the existing crypto asset market, and the blockchain itself aims to be decentralized based on principles.

## **Q,How is GUU different from JPU?**

GUU ($GUU) is a utility token for governance or commission used in the UnUniFi Protocol

## **Q,Why Does GUU Have Value?**

The GUU cryptocurrency is used to reward users who mint JPU, and it plays a key role in the governance of the UnUniFi Protocol.

More specifically, GUU distributes the management of operations on the network, enabling anyone who holds and stakes the cryptocurrency to vote on its software policies and rules.

This means that by owning and staking GUU, users can vote to change certain parameters of the software. These include, but are not limited to, the assets the protocol accepts as collateral, the collateralization ratio required and the fees paid by borrowers.

Users can also delegate GUU to the validators who manage its blockchain and compete for newly minted GUU, allocating votes to them to earn a portion of the stability fees paid by users closing their CDPs.

## **Q,Why Use GUU?**

UnUniFi Protocol may be appealing based on its ability to provide cryptocurrency owners with access to decentralized lending services.

Borrowing against one’s cryptocurrency allows users to retain ownership of these assets while receiving other collateral that can be used to purchase goods and services.

Investors may also seek to buy GUU should they believe in the promise of DeFi and the ability of these protocols to disrupt traditional financial services.

## **Q,What are the rules for borrowing JPU?**

On UnUniFi Protocol, JPU is often over-collateralized, meaning that borrowers must deposit an amount that is typically higher than the value of JPU minted by the protocol.

The ratio of debt-to-collateral is then used to calculate the liquidation price.

For example, a collateralization ratio of 150% would mean that a user will get liquidated if the value of the cryptocurrency locked in the protocol falls below 1.5x the JPU they have borrowed.

## **Q,What happens if the collateral assets fall in value and the required collateral is not enough?**

If the debt-to-collateral value drops below a specified threshold, the collateral held in smart contracts will automatically be liquidated and burned.

## **Q,What are the rules for repayment?**

There is no repayment deadline. The borrowed JPU can be used indefinitely.\
&#x20;You can withdraw your collateral at any time by returning the JPU.\
&#x20;You can also withdraw excess collateral at any time as long as you maintain a minimum collateral ratio.

## **Q,Who’s running it?**

It is operated by Botany LLP(Yu Kimura, Takeru Shimojima, Kenji Yanagisawa). It is mainly developed by the members of [CauchyE, Inc](https://cauchye.com).
