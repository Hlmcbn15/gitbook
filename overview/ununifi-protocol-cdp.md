# UnUniFi Protocol CDP

## What is it?

UnUniFi Protocol’s CDP is the same as that of Maker DAO, which allows users to lock crypto assets as collateral to generate JPU, a stablecoin based on Cosmos network. The generated JPU can be used for anything, including buying more crypto or trading it for fiat.

Users can generate up to two-thirds of the value of their collateral. However, this incurs debt in the user’s CDP account. This debt can be repaid in full or on a pro-rata basis to recoup the collateral. Failing to do so will result in the CDP being liquidated. Any collateral leftover from repaying the debt is then returned to the user with a minor liquidation fee.
