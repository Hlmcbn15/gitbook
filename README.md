# What is UnUniFi Protocol ?

## UnUniFi Protocol

White paper:[https://ununifi.io/assets/download/UnUniFi-Whitepaper.pdf](https://ununifi.io/assets/download/UnUniFi-Whitepaper.pdf)

UnUniFi Protocol is a decentralized finance(DeFi) platform that provides tools and features that allow users to create a collateralized deposit position, like that of MakerDao, to synthesize a number of assets pegged to legal currency, real-life assets, like stocks or commodities, crypto assets, and index of tokens,etc. Trading can be done by any person anywhere in the world, so the entry barrier is lowered to accommodate easy access to the financial market. Thanks to the technology used by the UnUniFi Protocol, users can manage and trade tokenized assets by creating synthetic assets without ever owning the actual stock or commodity they represent. Generally speaking, synthetic assets enable far more liquidity across global exchanges, swap protocols, and wallets than traditional derivatives are even remotely capable of. Synthetic assets make tokenizing and trading anything a reality. By enabling anything to be tokenized and brought onto the blockchain, synthetic assets unlock untold pools of global liquidity.Apart from simple market buying/selling and derivatives trading, synthetic assets create possibilities for seemingly infinite markets and combinations for new sources of value.

UnUniFi plans to issue stablecoins pegged to JPY, EUR, USD or especially index tokens on GameFi , Metaverse and NFT, which has yet to be realized by any protocol. This will enable the world to develop a new kind of finance that goes beyond existing finance and will contribute to further boosting the heated GameFi, Metaverse and NFT markets.

## Decentralized

UnUniFi Protocol is non-custodial. Users can mint/redeem JPU, EUU, USU or other synthetic assets without permission.

## JPU, EUU, USU

JPU, EUU or USU is a digital asset drawn from the UnUniFi Protocol on Cosmos Network. The price of JPU, EUU or USU are nearly equal to that of JPY, EUR or USD. A user can supply BTC or other cryptocurrencies to UnUniFi Protocol, borrow JPU, EUU or USU, and exchange that JPU, EUU or USU for other assets, goods, or services. Once the JPU, EUU or USU is repaid to UnUniFi Protocol, the user regains full access to their supplied BTC. The Stablecoins(JPU,EUU,USU) of UnUniFi Protocol has five primary use-cases: Users can draw JPU, EUU or USU, by locking collateral in a smart contract. Users may stake JPU, EUU or USU for a yield. When earning interest income, there is a huge demand for using coins with low price volatility as collateral. Users may take out a series of collateralized loans to create synthetic leverage for any supported crypto asset. For instance, it is possible to lock BTC and mint JPU, EUU or USU to buy BTC, hence creating a leveraged long position on BTC. Users can use JPU, EUU or USU on any chain connected to the Cosmos network. Users can issue a variety of Synthetic assets collateralized by JPU, EUU or USU.

## GUU

GUU is a utility token for governance or commission used in the UnUniFi Protocol. The Governance token of UnUniFi Protocol has three primary use-case: It requires a small amount of GUU as fees when conducting any transaction on the UnUniFi blockchain. Rewards for delegators participating in the UnUniFi Protocol operation. GUU tokens are used to vote on adjusting CDP parameters.
